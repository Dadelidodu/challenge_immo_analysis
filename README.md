## **Description**
Real estate data analysis challenge of the BeCode AI Bootcamp

The real estate company "ImmoEliza" wants to establish itself as the biggest one in all of Belgium. To pursue this goal, it needs to create a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's sales. That way, they can pick out the properties that are the most valuable to them.

But for this, it needs to do a preliminary analysis to gather some information. Having no in-house data scientist, they are looking for talented people to do it for them.

Since your last encounter with them went great, they reached out to you to do this job. Everything is in your hands now!

Take the dataset previously scraped to do the analysis.

#### Mission objectives

- Be able to use `pandas`.
- Be able to use Data visualization libraries.(`matplotlib` or `seaborn`).
- Be able to clean a dataset for analysis.
- Be able to use colors in visualizations correctly.
- Be able to establish conclusions about a dataset.
- Be able to find and answer creative questions about data.
- Be able to think outside the box.

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dadelidodu/challenge_immo_analysis.git
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd challenge_immo_analysis

3. Install the required Python packages
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Make sure the necessary files are available in '/data' directory.

## **Usage**
1. Run the Scripts/01_Dataset_cleaning:
   ```bash
   output is data/cleaned_dataset.csv

2. Run the Scripts/02_Dataset_normalizing:
   ```bash
   output is data/normalized_dataset.csv

3. Run the main.py:
   ```bash
   check if no error in script

4. Run this command in Terminal : 'streamlit run main.py':
   ```bash
   The app should run on Local Host and new tab will open in your browser

## **Visuals**
Visual representations are crucial for understanding data trends and patterns. Key visualizations created in this project include:

- Metadata Plots
- Regional Zooms
- Correlation Map
- Heat Map

## **App**
Immo Eliza app provides interactive visualisations which make the user really appreciate the data. 
It guarantees immediate insights and draws attention to the most interesting aspects of the data set.
